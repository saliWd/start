rather use: echo '<div class="row"><div class="twelve columns"><hr /></div></div>';        
than:       echo "<div class='row'><div class='twelve columns'><hr /></div></div>";        

php processes 'some string' faster than "some string" because the single quote notation does not replace any $variables (which is a bad thing anyway)

I'm using if/elseif-chains (like: "elseif ($doSafe == 4)") rather than switch statements as the switch statement is quite ugly in php: 
- it requires a break-command
- it doesn't have parenthesis {} and 
- generally requires more lines
