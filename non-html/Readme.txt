1) missing files:
-----------------------
To get a working setup, you need an additional file with data base connection information. File is called:
<root folder>/php/dbConn.php

and needs to open a dbConn like this:
<?php    
    // this file will be included in other files
    $dbConn = new mysqli("localhost", <your data base login information>); // Create connection
?> 


2) data base:
-----------------------
create a data base by executing the SQL command given in the file "widmediaDb.sql". This will create several tables
the admin of the site must have userid = 1, the test user must have userid = 2 (those two users are treated differently)
